Problem:
You observed that a lot of food was wasted because it was placed in the kitchen for too long and it needs to be thrown away because it has expired. You have decided to develop a software to help keep track of the inventory in the kitchen.
There are many type of food in the kitchen for example raw food such as fish, meat; dairy product such as milk, cheese; can food such as pasta sauce, condensed milk; and fresh produce such as vegetable and fruits. Your system allows user to scan in or key in the food every time when there is a purchase. It will keep track of the quantity available in the kitchen and the expiry date, etc.
The system should use the first-in, first-out sequence when a user key in an item to consume. It should also keep track of the inventory and give a warning when the stock is zero. It should also display a list of items to be expired in 3 days so that user can consume them before they expire.

Source Code Documentation: (8 Aug 2017)
The purpose of the source code documentation is to enable the succeeding programmers able to have a clear understanding on the inner working of the software at a glance. The document should contain all functions that were coded, brief description on the purpose of the function, variables used by the function and also any global variables declared in the software. You are free to use any available libraries, but you must explain what it is and what you are using the library for. Operating environment, such as the hardware platform, the type of development environment and the running environment should brief stated.

#include <iostream>
STL header file that allows input and output streams.

#include <string>
STL header file that allows string variables to be explicitly used.

#include <fstream>
STL header file that allows input and output with file streams.

#include <queue>
STL header file that allows queue container adaptor to be used, operating in a FIFO (first-in first-out) context.

#include <chrono>
STL header file that defines three main types (durations, clocks and time points) as well as utility functions and common type defines. 

#include <future>
STL header file that supports running functions in separate threads.

#include <ctime>
STL header file that returns current calendar time and converts it to a C-string containing corresponding time and date.

#include "display.h"
Header file which contains functions to display various menus and function choices.

#include "functions.h"
Header file which contains functions to add new items, and also count the number of items in a particular fstream file.

#include "timer.h"
Header file which contains a class which stores variables for time and days, and also functions to get system time, count the number of days from year 2000 and compare with various datas. 

#include "items.h"
Header file which contains a class which stores variables for the details of the item, including product category, product name, product code and the expiry date of the product.

using namespace std;
Declaration introduces a container for a set of identifiers, and eliminates the need to also type the std:: prefix constantly. 

item productDetail;
dateRegister datesData;
Creates an instance of productDetail from class item, and also an instance of datesData from class dateRegister.

queue<item> allCategories;
queue<item> displayCopy;
queue<item> displayDeleteCopy;
Creates a queue with a member type definition of class item, and a name of allCategories, where allCategories pushes the instance of an item into the queue. The queues displayCopy and displayDeleteCopy is a direct copy of allCategories, used when calling for functions to display and delete items.

int sizeToDisplay;
int numberOfLines;
Declares two integers, sizeToDisplay and numberOfLines. Their purpose is to know the total number of items, so the correct number of loops can be executed for various functions.

int functionChoice;
int displayTypeChoice;
Declares two integers, functionChoice and displayTypeChoice. Their purpose is to store the input data from the user, and use it for switch statements to enable the corresponding functions.

int codeToDelete;
Declares an integer, codeToDelete. It stores the input data from user and matches it with existing in the data in the queue to execute the delete function. 

int fstreamCategory;
string fstreamName;
int fstreamCode;
int fstreamDateDay;
int fstreamDateMonth;
int fstreamDateYear;
Declares five integers to store the category, code and expiry date of item, and a string to store the name of the item. Variables are designed for fstream.

int categoryX = 0;
string productX = "NULL";
int productCodeX = 0;
int dateDayX = 0;
int dateMonthX = 0;
int dateYearX = 0;
Declares five integers to store the category, code and expiry date of item, and a string to store the name of the item. All variables are initialized to 0 and NULL. Variables are designed for addNewItem function.

system("cls");
Call to clear system console, a function of STL.

displayProgramKeepsTrack();
displayChoice();
Function calls displayProgramKeepsTrack and displayChoice() shows the user the different options for different functions.

this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::seconds(1));
Function using <future> to call for a thread, and using chrono function to delay for 1 second. Variables (seconds, minutes, hours) can be changed.

auto getDate = async(&dateRegister::updateDate, &datesData);
auto dayCalculation = async(&dateRegister::dayMainCalculator, &datesData);
auto dayWarning = async(&dateRegister::dayAlarm, &datesData);
Function calls getDate, dayCalculation and dayWarning 

lineCount(numberOfLines);
